This document outlines the 5-step process for handling a user account deletion to ensure both data privacy and system integrity.

1. Initiation
A user requests to delete their account through the application's interface. This action triggers the deletion workflow.

2. Cancel All Pending Notifications
The system immediately finds all notifications for this user that have a 'pending' status. These notifications, which represent reminders that have not yet been sent, are permanently deleted from the database to prevent them from running after the account is anonymized.

3. Anonymize User Data via Hashing
For all personally identifiable information (PII) on the User model (e.g., first name, phone number), the system calculates a secure, salted hash of the value. This hash is then stored in a corresponding 'hash_' field (e.g., 'hash_first_name'). A special 'hash_email' field is also populated with the hash of the user's primary email address. Salt is used in the hashing process. 

4. Overwrite Personal Data
After the hashes are stored, the original fields are all set to null, expcept the email field which we give the value of user_pk_{user_pk}@deleted.com to satisify our unique constraint.

5. Overwrite notification model
The notification model has a record of the email, or number or whatever else it was sent to. this is a simple string field. This too needs to be hashed with salt. But the pk to the associated and now hashed user model remains.

6. Deactivate Account
Finally, the user's account is marked as inactive (e.g., 'is_active = False'). This action prevents any future logins and effectively removes the user's access to the system, completing the deletion process.
