Session Summary:

This session focused heavily on developing the frontend of the  application, including fixing existing issues, building new pages and components, and establishing a robust and reusable form architecture.

**Initial Fixes & Refinements:**
- Replaced various call-to-action buttons across the homepage with a single, consistent `CreateEventLink` component.
- Resolved a Django `SystemCheckError` by correcting the `ForeignKey` on the `EmergencyContact` model to point to the custom user model (`settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`).
- Fixed multiple TypeScript build errors, including exporting `ButtonProps` from the Button component and resolving issues in `AuthContext`.
- Corrected several UI layout bugs, such as a double footer on the homepage and ensuring the background color on the auth pages extends correctly to the footer.

**New Feature Development (Event Creation Flow):**
- Enhanced the `CreateEventForm` by adding "Event Name" and "Event Date" fields, which were identified as critical missing pieces.
- Created a new `ConfirmationPage` to be displayed after a user successfully submits an event.

**Reusable Authentication Forms:**
- Based on user-provided templates and discussion, a reusable `AccountCreationForm` component was built.
- This component was designed with two modes:
  1.  `'activate'`: For the "lazy registration" flow on the confirmation page, where a user sets a password for their auto-created account.
  2.  `'signup'`: For a traditional registration page, including fields for first name, last name, email, and password.
- A new `SignupPage` was created that utilizes the `AccountCreationForm` in `'signup'` mode and was linked from the main navigation bar.
- A display-only `LoginPage` was also created from a user template to set the stage for future login functionality.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- It was decided to use a single, "smart" component for both account creation and activation to ensure consistency and maintainability.
- The "lazy registration" user flow was established as a core design principle, where users can create an event first and optionally set a password later.
- The use of `react-hook-form` and `zod` was standardized for all forms, including the new account creation and activation forms.
- Fixed a `zod` runtime error related to schema extension (`.extend()` vs. `.safeExtend()`).
