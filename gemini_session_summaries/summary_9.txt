This session focused on extensive UI and styling refinements for the React frontend of the `futurereminder` application, specifically targeting the article pages and their components.

1.  **`CtaCard` Component Refinement:**
    *   The `CtaCard` component was refactored to support a new `horizontal` orientation, intended for use as a banner.
    *   The layout of this new horizontal card was iterated upon multiple times based on feedback, moving from a simple grid to a flexbox layout with evenly spaced content blocks (Branding, Features, Action).
    *   The text color for the feature list within the horizontal `CtaCard` was changed from a muted gray to black for better readability.

2.  **`ArticleLayout` Component Update:**
    *   The main content area of the `ArticleLayout` was restyled to have a white background (`bg-foreground`) and black text, replacing the previous dark theme.
    *   To support this change, all 7 existing article pages were modified to remove a conflicting text color class that was overriding the new default.

3.  **Article Content Styling (`ReminderAppsRanked.tsx`):**
    *   An initial attempt to style headers and bolded text with a blue (`primary`) color was implemented and then reverted at the user's request.
    *   A final, detailed styling task was completed: in the `ReminderAppsRanked.tsx` article, all the text labels for the rating criteria (e.g., "Cross-platform sync:") were made bold. This required a meticulous series of targeted `replace` commands to handle numerous and sometimes duplicate text strings across the file.

The session concluded with the successful completion of all styling requests for the article pages.
