This session involved a wide range of tasks, from frontend layout adjustments and bug fixes to significant backend refactoring and database model changes.

### Frontend UI/Layout Fixes

**TierChoicePage (`/events/:id/activate`):**
- **Horizontal Centering:** The tier selection cards were initially aligned to the left on desktop, which looked awkward when fewer than three options were available (e.g., in an upgrade flow). This was corrected by changing the container layout from `md:grid` to `md:flex` with `md:justify-center`.
- **Uniform Card Size:** The flexbox layout solved centering but caused the cards to have inconsistent widths and heights. This was addressed in two steps:
    1. A fixed width (`md:w-96`) was applied to each card to ensure uniform width.
    2. After some debugging, uniform height was achieved by removing the `h-full` class from the cards and adding `md:items-stretch` to the parent flex container, allowing it to control and equalize their heights.

### Bug Fixes

**ConfirmationPage (`ConfirmationPage.tsx`):**
- A `TypeError` was occurring because the code was calling `.toFixed(2)` on `event.payment_details.amount`, which was a string sent from the backend API (e.g., "4.99") rather than a number.
- The issue was resolved by wrapping the amount in `parseFloat(String(...))` to ensure it is always a number before formatting, making the component more resilient to the API's data type.

### Backend Model and API Enhancements

**User Model:**
- The Django `User` model (`users/models/user.py`) was enhanced with two new optional fields: `secondary_backup_email` and `backup_phone`.
- Corresponding `hash_` fields (`hash_secondary_backup_email`, `hash_backup_phone`) were also added to support the existing data anonymization process.
- Database migrations were created and successfully applied.
- The `UserProfileSerializer` was updated to include the new fields, making them accessible via the API.

**Frontend Integration:**
- The `UserProfile` TypeScript type was updated to include the new fields.
- The `ProfileForm.tsx` component, used on the `AccountManagementPage`, was modified to include form inputs for the new fields, allowing users to view and edit them.

### Sitemap Correction

- It was noted that several articles were missing from the project's `sitemap.xml`.
- Investigation revealed that the article list is hardcoded in a frontend component (`ArticleCarousel.tsx`), and the `sitemaps.py` file was a similarly hardcoded and out-of-sync list.
- Per user approval, the immediate solution implemented was to manually add the missing article URLs to the `sitemaps.py` file to ensure it accurately reflects all available articles.

### Major Backend Refactoring

**Merging `notifications` and `events` Apps:**
- A major refactoring effort was undertaken to merge the `notifications` Django app into the `events` app, as their logic and models were tightly coupled.
- The core notification creation logic was identified in `notifications/utils/schedule_notifications_for_event.py`, and it was confirmed that this logic would need future modification to handle the different service tiers.
- A comprehensive migration was executed:
    1. All models, utility functions, views, serializers, and templates were moved from the `notifications` directory to the `events` directory.
    2. Django settings (`INSTALLED_APPS`), admin registrations, and all URL configurations were updated to reflect the new structure.
    3. Numerous broken import statements across the project were fixed.
    4. New database migrations were generated and applied.
    5. The now-obsolete `notifications` directory was permanently deleted.
    6. Test files with broken imports were corrected, which involved recreating a `NotificationFactory` for the test suite.
- The result is a more consolidated and maintainable backend structure.
