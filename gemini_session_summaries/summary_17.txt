## Session Summary - summary_17.txt

This session focused on debugging an API endpoint and then creating and refining a new UI component on the frontend.

### Key Activities and Resolutions:

1.  **API Endpoint Debugging (`events` app):**
    *   **Problem:** A view test for event creation (`AuthenticatedEventCreateView`) was failing with a `405 Method Not Allowed` error.
    *   **Investigation:** I identified a redundant URL configuration in `events/urls.py`. The `EventViewSet`, managed by a `DefaultRouter`, already provided a `POST /api/events/` endpoint for creating events. A separate, single-purpose `AuthenticatedEventCreateView` was also wired up to `POST /api/events/create/`. The router was likely misinterpreting `/api/events/create/` as a request for an event with the ID "create", causing the error.
    *   **Verification:** I conducted a full codebase search to confirm that `AuthenticatedEventCreateView` and the `/api/events/create/` URL were not being used by any other part of the backend or frontend.
    *   **Resolution:** After explaining the redundancy and getting user approval, I removed the `AuthenticatedEventCreateView` class and its corresponding URL pattern from the `events` app, leaving only the clean, standard `EventViewSet` endpoint.

2.  **New UI Component (`TrustFeature`):**
    *   **Goal:** Create a new component for the homepage to build user trust, to be placed above the pricing section.
    *   **Initial Creation:**
        *   Created a new file: `frontend/src/components/TrustFeature.tsx`.
        *   Built the component with a title ("Built on trust, not data."), subtitle, and three bullet points as specified.
        *   Designed a two-column layout with text on the left and an image placeholder on the right.
        *   Used the existing `logo.webp` as the image.
        *   Imported and placed the new component into `frontend/src/pages/home.tsx`.
    *   **Responsiveness and Refinement:**
        *   **Problem:** The initial component was not responsive. The layout needed to change on smaller screens.
        *   **Iteration 1:** Modified the component to use responsive Tailwind CSS classes (`flex-col lg:flex-row`). The goal was to have the image stack on top of the text on screens 1024px and smaller, and for the image to be vertically centered on larger screens.
        *   **Correction 1:** The initial responsive implementation had the text appearing above the image on mobile. I corrected the JSX order to place the image first, ensuring it stacked on top.
        *   **Correction 2:** The image was stretching to fit its container. I added `object-contain` to maintain the aspect ratio and centered the image within its flex container.
        *   **Correction 3:** The user requested the image's max-height be progressively shortened. The class was adjusted from `max-h-64` to `max-h-48`, and finally to `max-h-32` to achieve the desired visual balance.

3.  **FAQ Component Enhancement:**
    *   **Request:** Increase the font size of the questions in the FAQ component for better readability.
    *   **Action:** Located the `Faq.tsx` component and identified that the questions were rendered by an `<AccordionTrigger>`.
    *   **Resolution:** Applied the `text-lg` Tailwind CSS class to the `AccordionTrigger` to increase the font size.
