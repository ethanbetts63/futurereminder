This session focused on resolving build errors, implementing new features and content, and successfully deploying the project to PythonAnywhere.

Initially, we tackled several build errors. This involved fixing TypeScript type errors for `phone_number`, `relationship`, and `notes` properties in the frontend, and removing an unused variable. A significant issue was a dependency conflict with `react-helmet-async` and React 19. We resolved this by removing the library and refactoring the `Seo.tsx` component to use React 19's native head management features, which was a cleaner, more modern solution.

Next, we focused on content and SEO enhancements. We changed an article's URL slug to be more user-friendly, which required updating the component file, the frontend router, and the Django sitemap. We then implemented `og:image` tags for all articles and the homepage to improve social media sharing previews. This involved creating a dedicated public directory for the images and updating the `Seo` component and all relevant pages. We also created a brand new article page from text you provided about remembering anniversaries and birthdays, which included generating a summary, adding it to the router, the sitemap, and the article carousel component. During this process, we also updated several article images with new ones you provided.

The final and most significant part of the session was deploying the application to PythonAnywhere. We systematically diagnosed and fixed a series of deployment issues. First, we configured Django's static file settings (`STATICFILES_DIRS` and `STATIC_ROOT`) to correctly handle the built frontend assets. We then debugged a build failure on the server, tracing it to an incorrect `.gitignore` rule that was preventing `index.html` from being tracked by Git. After fixing that, we resolved a "404 Not Found" error by configuring Django's `urls.py` with a catch-all route to properly serve the React single-page application. Finally, we fixed the resulting MIME type errors by setting the correct `base` path in the Vite configuration, ensuring asset paths were correct for a production environment. The session concluded with the website fully functional on PythonAnywhere.
