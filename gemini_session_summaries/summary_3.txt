This session focused on fixing bugs, implementing new UI features for the account management page, and addressing security concerns.

### 1. API and Authentication Fixes

-   **Public FAQ Endpoint:** We resolved a `401 Unauthorized` error when accessing the public FAQ list. The issue was caused by a global Django REST Framework setting that enforced authentication on all endpoints. We fixed this by explicitly disabling authentication for the `FaqListView` by setting its `authentication_classes` to an empty list.
-   **Persistent Logins:** We addressed a critical bug where user login tokens would become invalid after the Django server restarted. I explained that this was due to a temporary, auto-generated `SECRET_KEY`. We fixed this by generating a new, persistent, and cryptographically strong secret key and saving it to the project's `.env` file.

### 2. Git and Security

-   **Untracking `.env` file:** The user asked how to stop tracking the `.env` file, which had been accidentally committed. I provided the commands (`git rm --cached .env` and `git commit`) to remove the file from Git's tracking for future commits. I also explained that this does not remove it from past history on GitHub and strongly advised that all secrets in the file be considered compromised and replaced immediately.

### 3. Account Management Page (UI/UX and Debugging)

-   **Read/Edit Mode:** We implemented a read-only and edit mode for the user profile form. By default, the form is disabled. An "Edit" button in the card header toggles the form into an editable state, replacing the button with "Save" and "Cancel" options.
-   **Extensive Debugging:** We worked through several issues to get the account page working:
    -   **Routing Mismatch:** The page was blank due to a `No routes matched` error. The link in the `NavBar` pointed to `/dashboard/settings`, while the route was defined as `/dashboard/account`. We corrected this by aligning the file names, component names, link path, and route path to a consistent `/dashboard/account`.
    -   **Form Context Crash:** The page then crashed with a `useFormContext(...) is null` error. I identified that I had incorrectly used a standard HTML `<form>` tag instead of the special `<Form>` provider component required by the `shadcn/ui` library. I refactored the component to use the correct provider, resolving the crash.
-   **Component Clarification:** The user asked if the `UserDashboardLayout` component was still in use. I confirmed that it serves as the parent layout for all dashboard pages and explained its architectural benefit.
